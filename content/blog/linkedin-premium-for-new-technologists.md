During my office hours with [Techtonica](https://www.techtonica.org/), I often answer upcoming Software Engineers' questions about resumes and LinkedIn profiles. This week,
though, Juliana Snorek brought me some especially good questions about how to maximize the value of LinkedIn Premium in her job search. Her questions guided me to a more
cohesive way of thinking about this problem than I previously had, and I want to thank her for inspiring this post.

Maybe you've gotten into the tech industry recently, or maybe you're still trying to break in. LinkedIn offers premium trials and student discounts, but it's hard 
to tell which features to focus on using while you have that access. In this blog, I'll give you some tips for making the most of LinkedIn Premium as a new technologist. 
I'll leave the role fairly general here, because I think this advice applies whether you're a new software developer, QA analyst, or technical writer. The further you get from 
technical roles, the more personal discretion you may need to exercise, but I think at least some of this will be useful for anyone working or hoping to work at a tech company.

_Caveats:_ I've hired juniors several times, and I certainly have experience to speak from, but it's still just one person's experience. I'm hoping to give
you a great place to start, but you should always consider asking your mentor for more advice or help applying general advice like this to your specific situation. 

I think the most valueable features fall into two big categories %3A **connection** and **learning**. Connection features help you form the direct and indirect relationships that will
be critical to the development of your career. Learning features help you build knowledge that will help you build better connections or perform better in your new or desired
role.

# Connection Features
I'll start with the connection features, because connections are fundamental to building a career in tech. You can build all the knowledge you want, and it still won't help
you find a job unless people know that you know those things. The most important Connection features on LinkedIn Premium are **Open Profile** and **Connection Messages**. 

## Open Profile
When you first start a LinkedIn Premium subscription, you'll be guided through some options, like whether you'd like to display a badge on your profile. These are pretty good
suggestions for the general userbase, but skip over one thing I believe is critical for job-seekers and upcoming professionals seeking mentorshipâ€”Open Profile. LinkedIn's UI
describes the feature, "This Premium feature allows anyone on LinkedIn to contact you directly for free, even if they are not connected with you." This means that other users
who don't have LinkedIn Premium will be able to send you a direct message, even if you're not connected to them yet. Without this feature, users on free accounts who've hit 
the 5-messages-on-connection-requests-per-month limit won't be able to tell you why they're trying to connect, which can make filtering hiring managers out from spam hard or
impossible. Also, since you're likely still building out your professional network, non-premium users will be unlikely to be able to message you with opportunities.

The option to turn this on is a bit hidden, though! You can enable Open Profile directly below the Premium logo on the **Edit Intro** modal. You should be able to open that 
by going to [your profile link]/edit/forms/intro/new/ or with one of the topmost of the many edit buttons on your profile page. For example, I can get to it 
from https://www.linkedin.com/in/margaretfero/edit/forms/intro/new/ . 

## Connection Messages
You may have already guessed some of why this is important based on the previous setting, since a big part of the point is being allowed to receive messages. However, not 
everyone you're trying to connect with will have Premium or will have found that setting. As you attend events and meet new colleagues from other organizations, LinkedIn is 
a common way to connect for followup conversations. However, you'll often be meeting a LOT of people in a row. That can make it hard to keep track of who you wanted to talk to
about what and why. By including a message on every connection request, you can increase the odds that it will be accepted by helping the other person understand what you're
hoping to connect about, PLUS have a reminder for yourself later on of why you were so excited to talk to this person if it takes a bit for them to notice and accept your
request. 

You might already be experiencing some of the inbox inundation that makes this so important, but don't worry if you aren't yet. As you gain more experience in your
new field, the requests will come. Many of these will be people trying to sell you products and services (even if you don't actually have purchasing authority), researchers
hoping you'll share information your company NDA (non-disclosure agreement) likely covers, and recruiters who haven't read your profile and want to talk to you about a role 
unrelated to your skills and experience. That can get frustrating. Among the frustrating messages, though, are also easily buried messages you very much want to see. As the 
recipient, these include messages from great candidates for a role you're hiring, replies from friends, mentorship requests from people you'd be excited to work with, and
outreach from recruiters who have read your profile and would love to discuss your dream job. As the sender, you don't want to be the mentorship request somebody mistook for
a spam message. You can help avoid this by including a thoughtful note about what you'd like to discuss and why with this person in particular. 

I often reach out to people who seemed cool or whose work I'm excited about from in-person or online events with a connection request message like "Hi! Thank you for 
\[something they did that I genuinely liked\]. I'd love to chat more about \[one of our shared interests, either from what they said at the event or from reading their profile\]. 
Would you like to connect?" I've met some really great people and had fabulous conversations from this opener. The most important thing is that it's genuine. Most people love
helping juniors advance, and remember the help they received coming up. With connection requests, you can clarify that you're not an AI bot adding everyone in sight, but an 
actual user who would like to learn from their achievements.

# Learning Features
The most obvious learning feature of LinkedIn Premium is LinkedIn Learning. Especially at the entry/junior level, though, I think **Who's Viewed My Profile** is also a very 
important learning feature.

## LinkedIn Learning
[LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) is a courseware platform built into LinkedIn. It includes video-based courses (often with exercise files), an AI 
coaching text chat bot, and hands-on practice-based coding courses. I haven't been super impressed with the AI coaching responses so far, but it can be a helpful starting
point if you're feeling overwhelmed by the amount of content. The technical skills courses cover a range of languages and topics, and are mostly best-suited to languages or 
topics you haven't used much before. Where I feel like LinkedIn Learning really shines, though, are the core skills courses. One of the best ways to stand out as a junior- 
or entry-level professional is with strong core (sometimes called "soft") skills, and LinkedIn Learning covers a wide range of those topics. Whether you want to learn new
project management methodologies to improve your ability to work independently, teamwork essentials to learn how to demonstrate your value to the rest of your team, or business
communication, LinkedIn Learning has you covered.

You may also have access to LinkedIn Learning through your local public library or an educational institution, but the Premium Profile version has the added advantage of 
tracking your progress and letting you add completed courses directly to your profile. Some but not all of the organizational plans do that, so it's good to compare when you're 
deciding how valuable this particular feature is to focus on during your trial or early premium membership.


## Who's Viewed My Profile
Another way you can learn on LinkedIn Premium is by checking the **Who's Viewed My Profile** feature regularly, especially around times that you've posted content or updated
part of your profile. Updating your profile in particular can significantly influence whose search results you show up in, because some fields are prioritized for search usage. 
It's good to check who's viewing your profile and how they found you, then think about whether those are the people you need to have seeing your profile. If you're looking for
a new role as a software engineer, but half of your viewers are HR at chemical engineering companies, you probably want to tweak the words you're using to describe yourself
and your experience.

# Conclusion
LinkedIn Premium and starting off in a new career field can both sometimes feel like they're overwhelming. I hope that after reading this, you can narrow down your focus on 
at least the LinkedIn part of that to leave more brain space for the learning and connection-building you need most to grow.
