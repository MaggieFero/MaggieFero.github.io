This is my first post on my first 11ty site. I was pretty confused going through the tutorial from the official documentation, but @phildini pointed me to the *immensely* helpful repo [11ty/eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog/), which got me back on track. Overall, I expect this site to contain a few things: my bio, this blog, videos and possibly summaries of some or all of my talks, and possibly if I really get my act together even my LinkTree as a subpage. Who knows what the future may hold!
