This week I attended an [\#IAmRemarkable](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable) Workshop hosted by facilitator Amanda Ho Sang for participants 
from a handful of communities focused on women and nonbinary tech leaders. In this workshop, we learned about the origin of \#IAmRemarkable as an 
initially-women-focused initiative at Google, and how it has since grown into a movement for all to participate in building healthy self-promotional skills. 
We heard about and discussed the benefits of fact-based self-promotion and the ways in which we can create success for those around us by modeling it ourselves 
through showing examples of our achievements, rather than hiding them from others. Throughout the workshop, we were invited to participate in exercises that encouraged
us to think deeply and newly about the ways we are each remarkable, and what we have already accomplished. We were further challenged to put theory into practice by sharing
some of our accomplishments with the group, to help model that success for those around us in the workshop. I'm not sharing specific examples in this post to protect 
participants' privacy, but will share general descriptions of what we learned from each other. This post summarizes a few of my key takeaways:
- Self-promotion is important for more than just your own advancement.
- Your accomplishments are not only professional.
- Sharing accomplishments begets accomplishments. 

# Self-promotion is important for more than just your own advancement.
At the start of the workshop, I approached self-promotion as critical aspect of personal advancement, but underestimated the impact that appropriate, fact-based self-promotion 
can have on others. Not only does promoting your achievements help others see them who may be able to help you advance, it also helps others see that as an option available 
to them. This could be in terms of role modeling for less-experienced people who see themselves in you and aren't sure where to go with their careers yet, and can also go 
beyond that to help people with as much or more experience realize what they've already done and should be promoting about themselves. In the course of this workshop alone, 
several of us realized that an accomplishment someone else promoted was also something we had done ourselves or similar to one of our own accomplishments. Now we can go into 
the world with the confidence that this previously-overlooked experience of ours is valuable, and help others realize that achievement.

# Your accomplishments are not only professional.


# Sharing accomplishments begets accomplishments.
