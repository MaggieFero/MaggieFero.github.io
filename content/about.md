# About

Margaret is a passionate, growth-oriented leader with extensive experience in cross-functional collaboration throughout tech startups. They explored communication and information flow while an IC in technical documentation and information security. While in technical roles, they found opportunities for skill exchange and teamwork to better understand the goals commonly held by colleagues in every part of the organization. They've enjoyed learning with Human Resources, Customer Support, Client Experience, Technical Implementation, Sales, IT, and Marketing teams. They love to jump right into new challenges, from opensource projects and volunteering to professional work, with a fun new story from the first day of every job.

Margaret prioritizes engagement—both their own and their team's—always seeking opportunities to learn new things as well as to support the growth and career objectives of those around them. They love to build healthy and inclusive working environments using research-backed management practices. They believe that strong teams with sufficient autonomy can thrive in finding creative and flexible solutions to business problems together. Margaret also prioritizes risk assessment and management, seeking to improve users' experience rather than pursue short-term growth at all costs. 

Margaret is always available for volunteer opportunities, short-term consulting/projects, or board membership aligned to their values. They are also currently available for full-time work as Chief of Staff or COO at a mission-driven firm.
