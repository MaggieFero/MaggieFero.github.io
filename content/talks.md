# Talks & Presentations
This page includes a selection of my talks, with recordings and/or slides as available. If you have any questions about these, please reach out on social media or if you see me in person! You can also send an email, but I'm likely to miss it. 

I've sorted the talks by year for convenience, especially because some talks exist in multiple variants for different audiences or updates over time.

## 2025
I still have plenty of availability if you'd like me to speak at your event this year! 

### January 9 Techtonica Workshop
(Goal Setting for the New Year)[https://www.eventbrite.com/e/workshop-goal-setting-for-the-new-year-tickets-1115380496089]

This one doesn't have a public recording or slides currently, because they may make the video available by request in the future as a fundraiser.

## 2024 and earlier
I'm still working on adding in older talks, so please come back for speaking engagements before 2025!
